title: "Replication from 'The Colonial Origins of Comparative Development' (2009) - Acemoglu, Johnson and Robinson "
---

Acemoglu, Johnson and Robinson realized an empirical investigation that exploits differences in European mortality rates to estimate the effect of institutions on economic performance. Exploiting differences in European mortality rates as an instrument for current institutions, the researchers estimated large effects of institutions on income per capita. I replicate the figure of the relationship between the (potential) settler mortality rates and the index of institutions. The result was that there is an almost linear relationship between the settler mortality and the meausure the authors used for institutions.
