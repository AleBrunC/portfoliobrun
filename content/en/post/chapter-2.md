title: "IS-LM Model"
---

We use the IS-LM model to show how income and interest rate values that simultaneously equilibrate the goods market and the money market are determined. On the one hand, the equilibrium in the IS-LM model was mathematically derived. On the other hand, the effects of monetary and fiscal policies were analyzed. The effects were displayed graphically and the explanation of the effects was done using intuition and differentials.
