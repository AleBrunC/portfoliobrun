title: "AD-SA Model"
---

We use the AD-SA model to show the relationship between output (Y) and the price level (P). First,  we derived the aggregate demand and supply curves to then analyze the effects of fiscal and monetary policies, and the effects of a supply shock. The effects were displayed graphically and the explanation of the effects was done using intuition and differentials.
