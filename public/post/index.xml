      <description>We use the AD-SA model to show the relationship between output (Y) and the price level (P). First, we derived the aggregate demand and supply curves to then analyze the effects of fiscal and monetary policies, and the effects of a supply shock. The effects were displayed graphically and the explanation of the effects was done using intuition and differentials.

      <description>We use the IS-LM model to show how income and interest rate values that simultaneously equilibrate the goods market and the money market are determined. On the one hand, the equilibrium in the IS-LM model was mathematically derived. On the other hand, the effects of monetary and fiscal policies were analyzed. The effects were displayed graphically and the explanation of the effects was done using intuition and differentials.

      <title>Replication from &#39;The Colonial Origins of Comparative Development&#39; (2009) - Acemoglu, Johnson and Robinson </title>

      <description>Acemoglu, Johnson and Robinson realized an empirical investigation that exploits differences in European mortality rates to estimate the effect of institutions on economic performance. Exploiting differences in European mortality rates as an instrument for current institutions, the researchers estimated large effects of institutions on income per capita. I replicate the figure of the relationship between the (potential) settler mortality rates and the index of institutions. The result was that there is an almost linear relationship between the settler mortality and the meausure the authors used for institutions.</description>
